# icetone
A GUI Library for JME3 based on a heavily modified version of  Tonegod's 'Tonegodgui'.

It started life as an extension to TonegodGUI adding Swing-like layout managers, in particular 'Mig Layout'. However, TonegodGUI seems no longer maintained, and maintaining 100% compatibility with it seemed pointless. For the most part, porting an existing TonegodGUII application to icetone would mostly be a case a fixing imports. Although there is already some behaviour difference and will likely diverge more.

Now Mavenized, also added are a number of additional components such as Split Pane, Table, and an XHTML renderer based on Flying Saucer.
