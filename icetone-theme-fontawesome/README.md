# Icetone Fontawesome Theme

This pseudo-theme adds [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/) (4.7) icons. This has a permissive license and is OK to use in most open source and commercial applications.

## Using the Icons in code

You can set icons on your buttons and other controls using any `icetone.fontawesome.FontAwesome` enum.

```java
	FontAwesome.VOLUME_UP.button(32, myButton);
```
